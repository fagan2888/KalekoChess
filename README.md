KalekoChess
===========

Repository holding code David Kaleko has written related to chess in some way.


To get the GUI to work, you may need to install the PIL package
(You also need tkinter, but that comes with most mac distributions nowadays)

Here's how to install the PIL package:

curl -O -L http://effbot.org/media/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz

tar -xzf Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz

cd Imaging-1.1.7

python setup.py build

python setup.py install --user
