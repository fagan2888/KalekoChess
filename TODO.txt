* Opening repertoire database
[DONE]  * Function to read in txt file and save to dict
[DONE]  * Function to add to dict
[DONE]  * Function to save dict to text file
	   --> note, "pickle" module can save dict object directly, to bypass
	       having to save/read in a text file each time.
[DONE]  * Button to grep opening repertoire and spit text out
    	     saying my suggested next move, and comments.
[DONE]  * Button to open file dialogue to ask user to select repertoire file
[DONE]  * Button to open subwindow asking to enter next move and comments, to add to opening repertoire (and save file accordingly).
	* Additional dialog to make sure user wants to overwrite a move in the repertoire
	  if it's already there. (grep for "UH OH")


[DONE]  * Ability to flip board (ask user if he is playing white or black)

* Moves: (in order of importance):
[DONE] 	 * Castling
	 * En Passant
	 * Pawn promotion

[DONE] * Make an (internal) environment variable that points to top directory, then refer to it.

* Test to make sure FEN exporting works fine when board is flipped, etc. Also make sure castling string is working in export. Plug in to third-party FEN string reader website to check, maybe?

* Ability to "undo" a move and go back one. Is this possible from just one FEN string?
