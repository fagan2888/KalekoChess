The opening repertoire is saved in terms of FEN strings.
Each FEN string has an associated "nextmove" object with it.
There will be a dict of { "FEN_STRING" : "nextmove" }
The nextmove object should contain a string "move", and a string "comments"
(nextmove.move, nextmove.comments)

There will be a function to read in a text file repertoire into this dict.
There will be a function to append to the dict.
There will be a function to write the dict to a text file.
